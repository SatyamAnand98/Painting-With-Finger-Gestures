The HaarCascade folder contains two pretrained haar cascades able to detect eyes and faces in an image. The python program in the same folder is a simple program that accesses your webcam, displays a live feed and draws squares around the eyes and faces detected in the frame 

The hsv_trackbar python program is the one mentioned at the start of the development journey article. It simply displays trackbars and shows how changing hsv values affects the live feed from the webcam

The finger_painting program is the *main* program
